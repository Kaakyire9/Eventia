Eventia is an event management system app for anyone who want to view and create event. Eventia has been developed as part of the Code Institute's Full-Stack Developer course as my 3rd project - focusing on Django and Bootstrap frameworks, Database manipulation and CRUD functionality. It is for educational purposes only.
