## Validation


### HTML Validation

For my HTML files I have used [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

I have had to follow a different approach for validating my HTML for this project as the majority of my pages are developed using Jinja syntax such as '{% extends "base.html" %}' and '{{ form|crispy }}' and most require user authentication. The HTML validator will throw errors if I were to use my website's URL so I have had to follow the below approach for every page:

- Via the deployed Heroku app link, I have navigated to each individual page.
- Right clicking on the screen/CTRL+U/⌘+U on Mac, allows a menu to appear, giving me the option to 'View page source'.
- The complete HTML code for the deployed page will appear, allowing you to select the entire code using CTRL+A/⌘+A on Mac.
- Paste the copied code into the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) option.
- Check for errors and warnings, fix any issues, revalidate by following the above steps and record the results.

![html validation](documentation/testing/eventia_html_validation.png)  

All HTML pages were validated and received a 'No errors or warning to show' result as shown above.

Initially, the Event Detail and User Profile pages encountered validator errors due to extra paragraph tags generated by the rich text editor. This issue was resolved by replacing the problematic tags with div elements. After redeployment and re-validation, no styling issues were observed.

### JavaScript Validation

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the small amount of JavaScript code added to the project. External JS, for Bootstrap purposes, obtained via [CDN](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.2.3/js/bootstrap.min.js) was not validated through JSHint

| Page | Screenshot | Errors | Warnings |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| base.html | ![js from base.html](documentation/testing/base_js.png) | none | none |
| gallery.html | ![js from event.html](documentation/testing/eventia_events_js.png) | none | none |
| profile.html | ![js from profile.html](documentation/testing/eventia_profile_js.png) | none | none |

[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) was used to validate the Python files that were created or edited by myself. No issues presented and line lengths were double checked. I have included some screenshots with the results below.

| Feature | admin.py | forms.py | models.py | urls.py | views.py |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|


### Lighthouse Scores

Lighthouse testing was carried out in Incognito mode to acheive the best result. Performance was lower than preferred due to the site being image heavy. Images used in the sites design were saved in webp and png format, and compressed using [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) and [Convertio](https://www.convertio.co) to offer the best chance for a decent performance score. The CDNs used for Bootstrap were also noted in the Lighthouse report as causing issue with performance. This report will be reviewed for future development of Freefido to raise this score.
